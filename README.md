# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project
The Purpose of this project is to explore Heart Attack rate using Python

**Data Sources:**
heart.zip

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. **Column Identification:** All column names were reviewed for referencing in the analysis.
2. **Missing Data Identification:** Emphasis on the importance of handling missing values for data integrity.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- The EDA focuses on heart attack rates using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

**Visualizations:**
1. **Countplot:** Gender distribution within the dataset.
2. **Pie Charts:** Distribution of urban vs. rural and region-wise distribution.
3. **Bar Plot:** Family history of heart disease and cholesterol levels by region and alcohol consumption.
4. **Scatter Plot:** Age vs. cholesterol levels, segmented by gender.
5. **Boxplot:** Stress levels vs. cholesterol for different genders.
6. **Pair Plot:** Relationship between multiple variables, color-coded by heart attack likelihood and gender.
7. **Line Plots:** Trends in average cholesterol levels by age, chest pain types, and diet types.

This summary provides a structured view of the key elements and methodologies applied in the EDA project. For a detailed review, each section can be expanded based on specific code outputs and visualizations present in the notebook.
